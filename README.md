This  demonstrates the use of control statements in Java, which are essential for directing the flow of execution in a program. It covers the four major categories: decision-making statements (if, if-else, switch) used to make choices based on conditions; looping statements (for, while, do-while) used to execute code repeatedly; and jumping statements like break and continue, which alter the normal flow inside loops. It also includes examples of labeled and unlabeled break/continue statements, showing how labels provide more control when breaking or continuing nested loops. Together, these examples give a clear understanding of how Java programs control execution flow efficiently.
